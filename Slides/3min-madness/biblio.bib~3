@article{logical2009,
	abstract = {In this paper, we provide a logical formalization of the emotion triggering process and of its relationship with mental attitudes, as described in Ortony, Clore, and Collins's theory. We argue that modal logics are particularly adapted to represent agents' mental attitudes and to reason about them, and use a specific modal logic that we call Logic of Emotions in order to provide logical definitions of all but two of their 22 emotions. While these definitions may be subject to debate, we show that they allow to reason about emotions and to draw interesting conclusions from the theory.},

However, due to the scarcity of human and social behavioral data, these computational tools rely on assumptions that have been found inconsistent or unrealistic. This paper presents a multi-agent based framework for simulating human and social behavior during emergency evacuation. A prototype system has been developed, which is able to demonstrate some emergent behaviors, such as competitive, queuing, and herding behaviors. For illustration, an example application of the system for safe egress design is provided.},

Computational tools are now available for the simulation and design of emergency evacuation and egress. However, these tools rely heavily on assumptions about individual human and social behaviors, which have been found to be oversimplified, inconsistent and even incorrect. Furthermore, the behaviors are usually incorporated into the computational model in an ad hoc manner. This paper presents a framework for studying human and social behavior, from the perspectives of human decision-making and social interaction, and for incorporating such behavior systematically in a dynamic computational model suitable for emergency egress analysis.},

@unpublished{agentsBDI,
	abstract = {Modeling and simulation have long been dominated by equation-based approaches, until the recent advent of agent-based approaches. To curb the increasing complexity of models resulting from this new approach, the trend has been to oversimplify the models. Some more descriptive models have still been developed for various phenomenons, but the cognition of agents is too often neglected, despite its great importance in some fields, such as Social and Human Sciences. The solution that we put forward in this paper is to use BDI agents. We will show that this is an expressive, realistic yet simple paradigm that thus offers numerous benefits to agent-based simulation.},

@article{framework2015,
	abstract = {Abstract There is an increasing need for autonomous systems that exhibit effective decision-making in unpredictable environments. However, the design of autonomous decision-making systems presents considerable challenges, particularly when they have to achieve their goals within a dynamic context. Tactics designed to handle unexpected environmental change, or attack by an adversary, must balance the need for reactivity with that of remaining focused on the system{\rq}s overall goal. The lack of a design methodology and supporting tools for representing tactics makes them difficult to understand, maintain and reuse. This is a significant problem in the design of tactical decision-making systems. We describe a methodology and accompanying tool, \{TDF\} (Tactics Development Framework), based on the \{BDI\} (Beliefs, Desires, Intentions) paradigm. \{TDF\} supports structural modelling of missions, goals, scenarios, input/output, messaging and procedures, and generates skeleton code that reflects the overall design. \{TDF\} has been evaluated through comparison with UML, indicating that it provides significant benefits to those building autonomous, tactical decision-making systems.},

@techreport{review2014,
	abstract = {Risk perception (RP) is studied in many research disciplines (e.g., safety engineering, psychology, and sociology), and the context in which RP is studied varies greatly. Definitions of RP can be broadly divided into expectancy-value and risk-as-feeling approaches. RP is seen as the personalization of the risk related to a current event, such as an ongoing fire emergency, and is influenced by emotions and prone to cognitive biases. The present article is a literature review that differentiates RP from other related concepts (e.g., situation awareness) and introduces theoretical frameworks (e.g., Protective Action Decision Model and Heuristic-Systematic approaches) relevant to RP in fire evacuation as distinct from other related fields of research Furthermore, this paper reviews studies on RP during evacuation, especially on the World Trade Center evacuation on September 11, 2001. It discusses factors modulating RP, as well as the relation between RP and protective actions. This paper concludes with a summary of the factors that influence risk perception and the direction of these relationships (i.e., positive or negative influence, or inconsequential), the limitations of this review, and an outlook on future research.},
